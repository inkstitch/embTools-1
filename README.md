# embTools
A small utility program for embroidery professionals

This is just a collection of tools that I find helpful to have in one place without being overly complicated.

The tools include a stitch run time calculator, 2 databases (1 for client and 1 for vendor), unit conversions of the most common unit conversions that I deal with, a basic quote sheet with printing setup.
